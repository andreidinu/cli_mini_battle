Welcome to CLI mini-battle!

You will have to choose between 5 classes of fighters, each one with its particular strong and weak
points. Your character will start with full HP and Stamina and will lose then in consequence with
your actions. When it's your turn you can either attack (costs stamina), use your special ability
(uses more stamina) or stand still (will recharge your HP and Stamina).
Every 4 rounds your hero will have a 50% chance to take the bonus.

Each class has it's own unique ability on bonus.

Rogue: +1 Attack, +2 HP, +2 Stamina
Shaman: +3 HP, +3 Stamina
Hunter: +4 Attack
Priest: +3 HP, +3 Stamina
Warrior: +4 Attack

In the file log.txt you can see all the players' movements along the game.
